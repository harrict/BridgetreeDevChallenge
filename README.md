# Bridgetree Developer Challenge
In this challenge we would like for you to create a simple movie catalog application. The application should be built in .NET Core and Angular within a Docker container. Please also use a form of persistent storage to store the movie data. Below are the basic requirements:

* Movie Attributes: 
  * Title, Main Genre, Sub-Genre, Directorâ€™s Name, Date Released, Length (in minutes), and Description.
* Home Page: 
  *	List all movies in collection. Show Title, Genre, Director and Length
  *	Allow list to be sorted by all columns
  *	List should be pageable (show 10 movies at a time)
* Add/Edit Movie:
  *	Ability to add new movies or edit movie attributes
  *	All fields are required. 
* Additional Requirements:
  *	A movie can only have one Main Genre (list of genres - http://www.filmsite.org/genres.html)
  *	A movie can have multiple Sub-Genres (list of sub-genres - http://www.filmsite.org/subgenres.html)
  *	A director may be associated to multiple movies

Please complete your solution in a GitHub repo and provide the link to us. If you have questions, please reach out to your Bridgetree contact and we will get back to you.
